This project is a responsive travel website about Marrakech, created as part of a front-end development assignment.  
The goal of the project was to practice HTML, CSS, layout structure, responsiveness, and deployment using GitHub Pages.

## Design & layout

I had a clear idea of how I wanted the website to be structured from the beginning.  
The design is image-driven, with large visuals and calm spacing to create a welcoming and travel-inspired feel.

The color palette was chosen based on the main image on the home page.  
From this image, I extracted natural tones and synced them across the website to create a consistent and cohesive visual identity.

## Inspiration & topic choice

The choice to create a travel website about Marrakech comes from a strong interest in travel and culture of Morocco.  
Morocco has gained increased international attention following its historic fourth-place finish in the FIFA World Cup 2022.

Additionally, Morocco is one of the host countries for the FIFA World Cup 2030 and is currently hosting the Africa Cup of Nations, which further strengthens its relevance as a travel destination.

## Responsiveness

The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using:
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Mobile-first adjustments

The layout has been tested using browser developer tools for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## Technologies used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Pages for deployment

---

## Deployment

The website is deployed using GitHub Pages and can be viewed online via the repository’s GitHub Pages link.

## AI usage

AI-based tools were used as a learning support for:
- Debugging  layout issues that couldn't be solved after svereral own attempts
- Improving understanding of structure and responsiveness

All code was written, adapted, and implemented by me to ensure full understanding of the project.
